## AI Prototype for Data Categorization
🛠️ Objective
## Develop an AI model that can:

Ingest raw data (e.g., text from scientific papers, books, research articles).
Classify information into predefined categories (e.g., Science, Philosophy, History, Technology).
Summarize and extract key insights from the data.
## 📌 Suggested Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: spaCy (NLP), scikit-learn (classification), transformers (pre-trained AI models)
Data Source: Wikipedia, open-access research papers, historical documents
I'll create an initial Python script to handle basic text categorization.! 🚀
