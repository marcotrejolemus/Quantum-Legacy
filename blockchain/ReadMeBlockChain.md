## First Smart Contract for Knowledge Storage
🛠️ Objective
Develop a smart contract that can:

Store knowledge hashes on the blockchain.
Ensure immutability and verification of stored knowledge.
Allow querying of knowledge records by users.
## 📌 Suggested Tech Stack
Language: Solidity
Blockchain Network: Ethereum (Testnet)
Tools: Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, IPFS for decentralized storage
I'll also create an initial Solidity contract for this functionality. This is the first draft! 🚀
